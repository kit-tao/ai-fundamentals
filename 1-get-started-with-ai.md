### Introduction to AI

- **Machine Learning**: Foundation of AI. Teaches a machine to learn based on data
- **Anomaly Detection**: Automatic error detection based on anomaly
- **Computer Vision**: Interpretation of images and video
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: Interpret written or spoken language
- **Knowledge mining**: Information extraction from unstructured data

### Machine Learning

Definition: The foundation for most AI solutions

How does it work:

- Machines (computers) learn from data
- AI uses data to make predictions and inferences
- Machine learning models capture the relationship between data.
- Data Scientists use data to train machine learning models to make predicitons based on data.

### Machine Learning on Azure

- **Automated ML (AutoML)**: Create effective ML models with no expertise needed
- **Azure ML Designer**: A GUI for no-code development of ML models
- **Data and Compute**: Cloud-based resources for data scientists tu run experiments
- **Data metric visualization**: analyze and optimize experiments with visualization
- **Notebook**: write and run code in Jupter Notebook servers that directly integrated in the studio

### Anomaly Detection

Definition: Analyzing data over time to identify unusual changes

**Anomaly Detector**: An Azure service with an API to create anomaly detection solutions

### Computer Vision

Definition: Area of AI for visual processing based on interpretation of images and video
e.g. Seeing AI app - an example of the power of computer vision

**Models and capabilities**

| Task | Description |
| -    | -           |
| Image Classification | Classify images based on content. For example _is this a car or a bike?_ |
| Object Detection | Classify individual objects and location within an image using a box |
| Semantic Segmentation | Similar to object detection that uses an overlay to color-code distinct objects|
| Image Analysis | Extract information from images including tags for easier cataloging|
| Face detection, analysis, and recognition | Finds human faces in an image. Can be used with facial geometry to recognize individuals|
| Optical Character Recognition (OCR) | Detect and extract text in images, like a road sign or building number|

Azure Services

**Azure AI Vision**

Features:
- **Image Analysis**: Azure AI Vision - Analyse images and videos to extract descriptions, tags, objects and text
- **Face**: Face detection and facial recognition solutions
- **Optical Character Recognition (OCR)**: capabilities for extracting printed or handwritten text from images, enabling access to a digital version of the scanned text.

### Natural Language Processing

Definition: Area of AI that understands written and spoken language

Uses:

- Analyze and interpret text in documents
- Interpret spoken language
- Translattion of written and spoken languages
- Interpret commands and determine approriate actions

Azure Services

Azure AI

- **Language**:  Understand and analyze text or spoken language to build smart applications
- **Translator**: Translation service for more than 60 languages
- **Speech**:  Recognize and synthesize speech and translate to other languages
- **Azure Bot**: Conversational AI with the ability to connect to channels like email, Teams, and web chat


### Document Intelligence and Knowledge Mining

**Document Intelligence**: deals with managing, processing and using high volumes of variety of data found in forms and documents. Create software to automate processing of contracts, health documents, financial forms.

Uses:
Document Intelligence Studio to build solutions that manage and data collection from scanned documents.  

**Knowledge Mining**: extracting information from large volumes of unstructured data to create a searchable knowledge store.

**Azure Cognitive Search**- Knowledge mining solution capable of image processing, document intelligence, and natural language processing to extract data.

###  Understand generative AI

**Generative AI**: has abilities to generate original content.  It takes natural language input and return approriate responses in variety of formats including natural language, image, code and audio.

**Generative AI in Azure**

Azure OpenAI service can be used to build generative AI solutions.  It supports many foundation model choices that can serve different needs. The service feature is available for use in Azure OpenAI Studio and other programming languages.

### Challenges and Risks

Challenges or risks:

- **Bias**: Trained data might rely heavily on specific race, or geography
- **Errors**: Mistakes can cause harm (e.g. autonomus vehicles)
- **Exposing data**: Non-compliant solutions that don't remove Personal Identifiable Information (PII)
- **Accessibility**: A solution might not work with individuals with disabilities
- **Complex systems**: Users must trust how solutions are generated (e.g. from what data)
- **Liability**:  Who/what is liable for decisions?

### Responsible AI

AI development at Microsoft uses 6 principles:

Fairness: AI systems should treat all people fairly

Reliability & Safety: AI systems should work reliably and safely

Privacy & Security: Respect privacy and consider security at all times, even after deployment

Inclusiveness: Empower everyone regardless of ability, gender, and other factors

Transparency: Systems shouold be understandable. People can trust it.

Accountability: People should be accountable. Engineers and designers should work with a governance framework


### Fundamentals of Azure OpenAI Service

Capabilities of OpenAI AI models

There are several categories of capabilities found in OpenAI AI models, three of these include:

| Capability | Examples |
| - | - |

| Generating natural language | Such as: summarizing complex text for different reading levels, suggesting alternative wording for sentences, and much more |

| Generating code | Such as: translating code from one programming language into another, identifying and troubleshooting bugs in code, and much more |

| Generating images | Such as: generating images for publications from text descriptions and much more |
